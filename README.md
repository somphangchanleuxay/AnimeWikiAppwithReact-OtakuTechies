  PROJECT USER STORY
  AS  a Anime/Manga fan
  I WANT an online platform that provides comprehensive information about anime and manga titles
  SO THAT I can explore, discover, and engage with my favorite content

  GIVEN a well-organized and user-friendly website
  WHEN I navigate to the homepage
  THEN I expect to find intuitive navigation options and clear sections for different functionalities

  WHEN I use the search feature
  THEN I anticipate finding specific anime or manga titles by their name, genre, or other criteria  
  AND I expect advanced filtering options to refine search results

  WHEN I view the details of a title
  THEN I look forward to accessing comprehensive information such as synopsis, episode/chapter list, character profiles, and user ratings/reviews
  AND I expect additional content such as trailers, promotional images, and related recommendations

  When I interact with the website
  THEN I expect to create a personal account/profile
  AND I anticipate being able to save favorite titles to a watchlist, rate and review anime/manga, and participate in community discussions or forums

  WHEN I use the website
  THEN I value security and privacy measures such as secure authentication (e.g., JWT) and data encryption to protect my account details and browsing activity
